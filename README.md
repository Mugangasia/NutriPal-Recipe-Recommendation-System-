Capstone Project at Moringa School Phase 5 
NutriPal Recipe Recommendation System
# Project Overview 
In the rapidly growing health and wellness industry, individuals are increasingly seeking practical solutions to make informed dietary choices and improve their overall well-being. However, navigating the vast array of diet plans, meal delivery services, and health apps can be overwhelming. Stakeholders in this industry face the critical challenge of providing personalized and accurate nutrition recommendations that meet individual's unique needs and preferences.

A significant problem is the lack of tailored nutrition guidance available in the market. Existing solutions often offer generic diet plans that do not consider individual factors such as age, gender, body composition, dietary restrictions, and cultural preferences. Consequently, individuals may experience frustration and disappointment when these solutions fail to deliver the desired results, leading to a decline in motivation and a higher likelihood of abandoning their healthy eating goals.

Furthermore, the fast-paced nature of modern lifestyles presents another obstacle. Many individuals struggle to find the time and energy required to research, plan, and prepare nutritious meals regularly. This often results in resorting to unhealthy eating habits, negatively impacting their overall health and well-being.

By providing accurate and personalized nutrition recommendations, stakeholders in the health and wellness industry can differentiate their offerings, enhance customer satisfaction, and foster long-term adherence to healthy eating habits. Additionally, utilizing advanced technologies and user-friendly interfaces can create a competitive advantage and position stakeholders as leaders in the market.

# Problem Statement
The global prevalence of obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases is increasing. This is due in part to the increasing availability of unhealthy foods and the difficulty people have in making healthy food choices.

A food recommendations system could help people make healthier food choices by providing personalized recommendations based on their individual needs and preferences. This could help people improve their diet and reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases.
