i baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.

the cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar ""by intuition""; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet!

i have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.

i personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.","['eggs', 'sugar', 'baking soda', 'liquid honey', 'margarine', 'flour', 'sour cream', 'honey', 'plain sweet biscuit crumbs', 'ground walnuts']",10,,,141,0.02096531032075513,0.03828483920367535,0.00596252129471891,0.0004946297343131713,0.025089605734767026,0.026272577996715927,0.009107468123861567
